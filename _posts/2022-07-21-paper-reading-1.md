## Brief Summary
The paper proposes two testing coverage criteria: Neuron-Level Coverage Criteria and Layer-Level Coverage Criteria and give correspoding formula to measure deep
learning framework quantivly.

## Positive Aspects
1.	The first one to think about testing deep learning system and it is valuable for
its own idea.


## Limitations
1.	It only considers about the coverage aspect, but the overfitting problem
is very common in DL frameworks. Chasing the high coverage of nuron-level and layer-level may lead to this problem.
