Hi! My name is Runze Yu (余润泽 in Chinese). I am currently a software developer in Alibaba. Before entering Alibaba, I made research in [CSTAR](http://cstar.whu.edu.cn/) lab and received my
master degree from School of Computer Science, [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/) in 2021 and under the guidance of
my supervisor, [Jifeng Xuan](http://jifeng-xuan.com/) . For my graduate period,I got my B.Eng. Degree from School of Software, [Northwestern Polytechnical University](https://www.nwpu.edu.cn/) in 2018. Now, I am trying to applying for a Ph.D. position to continue my research career.

<!-- Before coming to Westlake University, I obtained my bachelor's degree of Engineering from School of Computer Science, [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/), majoring in Software Engineering. -->

<!-- I am **seeking research intern opportunities in 2022** for solving challenging research problems in the domain of data-efficient learning. Please refer to my [CV (Chinese)](https://kyonhuang.top/files/SitengHuang-CV-cn.pdf) and feel free to drop me an email if you are interested! My email address is `huangsiteng [at] westlake.edu.cn`.

## Research Interests

I am interested in software testing, program analysis and the intersaction of AI and SE. In particular, I have received systemic scientic training during my master period. For example, I made a deep research in the purity analysis of Java methods. In this project,
I use static program analysis and machine learning to solve a classic problem in the field of SE and apply the result to automatic test case generation. In details, I used Spoon to extract Java code features and improved the quality of auto-generated test cases by Randoop and EvoSuite. Another academic work is about purity reversals between continous projects, and I made a preliminary research on 10 famous
Github projects and guaranteed the validity of auto-generated assertions for regression testing.
